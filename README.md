ðŸ§  Projects
Welcome! This repository is a growing garden of personal projects â€” academic, business and those just for fun.


ðŸŽ“ Academic Zone
Here you'll find some useful explorations, like:

Interactive calculators

and more


ðŸ’¼ Business & Analytics
This section features synthetic-data projects that I can show to the world:

ðŸ“Š Data-Driven Management Accounting
ðŸš› Supply Chain Performance Dashboards
ðŸ“ˆ Marketing Mix & Segmentation Analytics
ðŸ’¡and more


ðŸ›¸ For the Love of Space
Iâ€™ve got a soft spot for astronomy and astro-data. This corner is for amateur but passionate:

Satellite data visualisations
Orbital calculator prototypes
Astro-data experiments

ðŸ“Œ Everything here is a work in progress â€” but if you find something useful, cool, or funny, feel free to star, fork, or reach out.

Best,

Anastasia Reich
