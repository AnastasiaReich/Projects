ðŸ§  Welcome! This repository is a growing garden of personal projects â€” academic, business, and those just for fun.

ðŸ“š **Academic Zone**  
Here you'll find useful explorations, like:  
Interactive calculators, statistics mini-labs, quantitative economics visuals, and more.

ðŸ’¼ **Business & Analytics**  
This section features synthetic-data projects I can share with the world:  
ðŸ“Š Data-Driven Management Accounting, ðŸš› Supply Chain Performance Dashboards, ðŸ“ˆ Marketing Mix & Segmentation Analytics, ðŸ’¡ and more.

ðŸ›¸ **For the Love of Space**  
Iâ€™ve got a soft spot for astronomy and astro-data. This corner is for amateur but passionate:  
Satellite data visualizations, orbital calculator prototypes, astro-data experiments.

ðŸ“Œ Everything here is a work in progress â€” but if you find something useful, cool, or funny, feel free to star, fork, or reach out.

Best,  
Anastasia Reich
