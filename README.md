Welcome! This repository is a growing collection of various projects â€” academic, business, and those just for fun.

Interactive calculators, statistical mini-labs, quantitative economics models, and more.

ðŸ’¼ **Business & Analytics**  
This section features synthetic-data projects I can share with the world:  
ðŸ“Š Data-Driven Management Accounting, ðŸš› Supply Chain Performance Dashboards, ðŸ“ˆ Marketing Mix & Segmentation Analytics, ðŸ’¡ and more.

ðŸ›¸ **Amateur Space Data Experiments**  
I have a soft spot for amateur astronomy and astro-data.

Everything here is a work in progress â€” if you find something useful, cool, or funny, feel free to star, fork, or reach out.

Best,
